# Directives
Directives are mainly intended for reusing logic that involves low-level DOM access on plain elements.
Directive is defined as an object containing lifecycle hooks similar to those of a component.
The hooks receive the element the directive is bound to.

## Available directives
There are 7 available directives:
- [Body scroll lock](/?path=/docs/utilities-directives-body-scroll-lock--with-directive)
- [Click outside](/?path=/docs/utilities-directives-click-outside--with-directive)
- [Focus first](/?path=/docs/utilities-directives-focus-first--with-directive)
- [Focus trap](/?path=/docs/utilities-directives-focus-trap--with-directive)
- [Highlight](/?path=/docs/utilities-directives-highlight--with-directive)
- [Keyboard focus](/?path=/docs/utilities-directives-keyboard-focus--with-directive)
- [Scroll tabindex](/?path=/docs/utilities-directives-scroll-tabindex--with-directive)

## How to use
To use our directives, just add the directive name to the element
```html
 <div v-body-scroll-lock></div>
```
Directives arguments can be dynamic.
```html
 <div v-click-outside:[arg]="handler"></div>
```
For all of our directives, we have separate story where you can see how it works
