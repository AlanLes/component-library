# Body scroll lock
This directive doesn't work well inside storybook.<br/>
After adding this directive and when element is visible body can't be scrolled and scrollbar is hidden.

## How to use 
* `v-body-scroll-lock` - set scope
* `:body-scroll-lock-ignore='true'` - allow to scroll element inside scope
```html
  <dialog 
    class="wrapper"
    v-clock-scroll-lock
  >
    <div 
      class="wrapper__scrollable-content"
      :body-scroll-lock-ignore="true"
    >
      ...
    </div>
  </dialog>
```
